ÿÀThis is a small little example showing you how to create your own custom menu.
Menu uses no API code or any ActiveX Controls
Most items the example uses is one picture box and some labels for menu captions. 
the rest is all drawn using the line function.

Anyway it still is little buggy but you may get an idea of this for your own project. 
Or if you want to fix my bugs please feel free to.

Hope you find this code usfull. please Vote
